# newBechdelScoreProject
## The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a variety of data structures can be used to investigate questions about a particular real-world domain, in this case, the Gender Imbalance in Movies

Here we look at a variety of tests, including the Bechdel Test which asks:
1. Does a movie have at least two named female characters? 
2. Do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man? 

In this project we utilize these tests to assign movies a FeministScore which allows us to define movies as _feminist_ or not.
